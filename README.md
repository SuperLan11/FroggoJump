# leap-of-faith-jam-2023

Froggo Jump was initially created as a game for the Florida Poly 2023 Respawn Game Jam, where our team of four created the game from scratch in 72 hours with Unity.
Our team continued to work on the game until the Game Expo held on December 2nd.
Since the game's initial release, additions included a level menu, four new levels, and a new mechanic.
The game now has seven levels total.

Due to difficulties with scheduling meetings for the team to work during the semester, the player movement and several of the levels are still unpolished.
Levels 3 through 7 were much harder than anticipated, mainly due to time constraints and a lack of playtesting.
While the team could continue to polish on the game, most of the members are interesting in pursuing new projects.
