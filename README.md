## Project Background
Froggo Jump was created during the Florida Poly 2023 Respawn Game Jam which had the theme "Leap of Faith." 
Our team of four created the game from scratch in 72 hours using Unity. It consisted of three levels exploring two mechanics.
After the Jam, our team continued work on the game for roughly two months until the Florida Poly Game Expo on December 2nd.
The expo version of the game added a level menu, four new levels, and a new mechanic.
The game now has seven levels total.

Due to difficulties with scheduling meetings for the team to work during the semester, the player movement and several of the levels are still unpolished.
Levels 3 through 7 were much harder than anticipated, mainly due to time constraints and a lack of playtesting.
While the team could continue to polish the game, most of the members are interested in pursuing new projects. 
Through this project, the team gained invaluable insights on ways to make a game fair, fun, and intuitive.
